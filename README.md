## Software

### Main Software

- Python 3.6+

For all projects, we are going to default to `python 3.6.0` and above. If you do not have the up-to-date python version, you can update your python using homebrew (<https://brew.sh/>) or through Anaconda (<https://www.anaconda.com/>).

Note: it is recommended to get your python through homebrew because it will be placed directly in your `/usr/local/bin/` directory, for Mac systems, which will not cause trouble when your MacOS is updated.

To check what python version you have, you can do:

```shell
python3 --version
```

if you're not sure if you have python3 installed, do:

```shell
python --version
```

### Other Software

There is no strict restriction on other software to stay compatible with everyone else; however, if you're using other kind(s) of software, please make sure to checkout [Project Structure --> Packages](#packages) for more detailed directions.

## Project Structure

Since this project is written by students, we need to anticipate real events such as graduation, that would result in the loss of the code creator. As such, we're choosing possibly the easiest way to keep everyone's code relevant, with nearly zero maintenance, that will ensure the survival of each individual's work in case of any unexpected leave. Consequently, this will hopefully ensure the longevity of the overall endeavor. The way we're going to organize everyone's project is through python modules ([below](#python-modules))

### Python Modules

If you haven't heard of python modules please check it out real quick (<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html>).

In summary, python modules is the go-to for building large python projects. As the name implies, we can modularize each individual's project and easily integrate everyone's code together when we need to. There are also some added benefits of flexibility, and general compatibility which might come in handy down the road.

#### Python Modules Quick Tutorial

Let's say you're working on a project inside `midterm-q1/` directory, and you'd like to convert your project into a python module. There are a few things you need to do. 

First of all, create an empty file called `__init__.py` at the top level of your directory. This file tells the python interpreter that this directory is meant to be a python module. For an additional functionality, please place your main script inside another file called `__main__.py`, and within your `__main__.py`, at the very bottom of the file, place the following block of code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Lastly, you will need to place the main logic (entry point) within a function called `main()` somewhere above the code block.

##### project directory

Your project directory might look like:

```shell
midterm-q1/
            __init__.py
            some_stuff.py
            __main__.py
            README.md       # your README
            packages/       # checkout #Packages
            docs/           # checkout #Docs
            .git            # created by git
            .gitignore      # you might need to create one
```

And inside your `__main__.py`, the code might look like:

```python=1
def main():
    parseFlags()
    doSomeStuff()
    outputJSON()

def parseFlags():
    ...

def doSomeStuff():
    ...

def outputJSON():
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Having the `__main__.py` clearly defines your program entry point. As a result, your program, e.g. `midterm-q1` is directly callable like:

```shell
python3 midterm-q1 <arguments>
```

This way, future maintainers do not even need to open up your code and dig through project directory in order to use your code. To make your code more programmer-friendly, checkout [Flags](#flags).

#### Optional

In an attempt to future-proof the durability of your code, you can turn your `__main__.py` into an executable in Linux based systems by:

##### Step 1

Add a python path to top of your `__main__.py`. On my computer, after downloading python 3.7+ using homebrew, my python3 path is: `/usr/local/bin/python3` . So, at the top of my `__main__.py` I can add: `#!/usr/local/bin/python3` . You can find out the path to your python by doing:

```shell
which python3
```

Then just paste the path to the top of `__main__.py` like:

```shell=1
#!<path>
```

##### Step 2

Once you've modified the top of your `__main__.py`, you need to turn the file itself into an executable. To do it, navigate to the directory where your `__main__.py` lives, then do:

```shell
chmod +x __main__.py
```

doing this will give execution privileges to anyone with a copy of your file, and they will be able to execute your `__main__.py` like:

```shell
./__main__.py
```

without calling `python3` for example.

### Packages

It is highly recommended that you search for existing libraries or packages that will solve your problem instead of reinventing every wheel. As a result, you might need to download some libraries that are not part of the standard python libraries.

When you do need to download packages, please put them inside a directory called `packages/`. This makes it easy for future maintainers to understand what code is downloaded, and they can perform updates if necessary. The downloaded packages will also enable your program to run off-line, and be resistant to package updates.

### Docs

Since this project is very distributed in personnel that consist of students, good documentation is key to enable others to properly use your program. For large programs, you might have multiple documentation files for different sections of your code, you should place these documentation files within a directory called `docs/` for easy future access.

Note: your `README.md` that is meant to explain your program should still be at the top level of your project directory (see [project directory](#project-directory)). Files within `docs/` are files like `help.txt`, `direction.txt`, etc.

### README Markdown File

You should write and actively maintain a file called `README.md` that appears at the front page of your github repository. Besides introducing your program, what it is, what it does, etc.

If you haven't seen files like this, or haven't used markdown before, no worries, it is not difficult to learn. For a quick summary, `README` is basically a file that a user to a program should read before proceeding to using the program. If you write your `README` in markdown, Github will automatically render it at the front page of your repository for others to see. And markdown is a simple popular markup language that lots of people have written tutorials and cheatsheets on. For example, the following link (<https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>) is one of those cheatsheets.

**Your `README.md` should explain how to interact with your program!**

Consider your `README.md` as a user manual for your program. It should include all essential commands, flags and options that your program consumes. It is okay to leave out the nitty-gritty details that's not essential to using your program to directories like `docs/` ([above](#docs)).

As a side note: we encourage you to write manuals like these and upload them to Github; instead of writing them in Google Doc for example. Reason being the ease of maintenance and version control. If you create a document like this and wish to share with others, what access privilege do you give others? If you do view only, what happens if someone updates your program and need to update the manual itself? If you do writable, what happens if someone accidentally deletes important content without realizing or anyone knowing? And linking Google Docs as manual is especially dangerous, consider if you graduate and you delete your Google Drive, the link to your user manual will be invalid, and no one will be able to use your program üôÅ

### Assets

As a side note, if your project is rather complex and requires various data types, or even caches. It is recommended that you place your `packages/` directory ([above](#packages)) along with `docs/` directory ([above](#docs)) under a directory called `assets/`, this way, you don't clutter your top level directory with all kinds of stuff. For example, if you have pre-prepared images, your `assets/` directory might look like:

```shell
assets/
            packages/
            docs/
            images/
            miscellaneous/
```

## Program Arguments

Many programs take arguments to let users interact with the program in many different ways, and your program should too.

Some common ways to pass arguments to your program involve flags and configuration files. Below points have outlined both.

### Arguments and Flags

Flags refer to those dash (`-`) and english letter options you can pass to your program at startup. One example is your everyday `ls` like: `ls -a -l` or `ls -al` . In this example, `-a` and `-l` are flags that enable formatting of your `ls` program outputs. Arguments are those you can specify values instead of just turning something ON or OFF, like: `gcc -o example example.c` in this example, `-o` is the option, and `example` is the value.

You can make your program more dynamic and configurable through the use of arguments and flags.

To parse these arguments, python has a handful of standard libraries with nice APIs that you can import. One recommended parser is `argparse` and you can check it out here: (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html>). It requires a bit of additional reading, but learning this will make your life much easier in the future. Additionally, many languages have powerful, built-in general purpose parsers like this one, learning one will make it easier to learn other parser in the future.

As a side note: it is worth the time to populate the description fields, as well as additional usage text so that when a user does `python3 <program name> -h` the help message might be enough to get the user started, instead of having to read through `README` on Github.
